I am Hyukpyo Hong. I am currently a Van Vleck Assistant Professor in the [Department of Mathematics at the University of Wisconsin - Madison](https://math.wisc.edu/). My postdoctoral mentor is [Gheorghe Craciun](https://people.math.wisc.edu/~craciun/). I received my PhD in mathematical sciences from [KAIST](https://mathsci.kaist.ac.kr/home/en/), where I studied under the guidance of [Jae Kyoung Kim](http://mathsci.kaist.ac.kr/~jaekkim/). Before that, I got my Bachelor's degree in mathematical sciences from KAIST.

I am working on mathematical biology. Among numerous interesting topics, my research interests are chemical reaction network theory, stochastic model reduction method (especially quasi-steady-state approximation), Bayesian statistical analysis to infer the mysterious dynamics of biochemical reaction networks.

Beyond the mathematical topics I am working on collaborative works to solve biological problems. One is developing non-invasive biomarker to diagnose congnitive impairment from wearable data.
